## 1. Docker – Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### Build and run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### What happens when you run this

| Order | Step | Service | What happens |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **Postgres image** | db | Uses pre-built `postgres:16-alpine`. Container `gotyolo-db` starts, creates DB `gotyolo`, user `app`. Data stored in volume `pgdata`. |
| 2 | **Healthcheck** | db | Waits for `pg_isready` to pass. App will not start until DB is ready. |
| 3 | **Node image build** | app | Builds from `Dockerfile`: `node:20-alpine`, copies `package.json`, runs `npm ci`, copies source code. Produces image `gotyolo-app`. |
| 4 | **App container start** | app | Container `gotyolo-app` starts. It depends on `db` being healthy, so it waits for step 2. |
| 5 | **Schema** | app | Runs `node scripts/run-schema.js`: drops `bookings` and `trips` (if exist), recreates tables and enums from `schema.sql`. |
| 6 | **Seed** | app | Runs `node scripts/seed.js`: inserts 7 trips (incl. 2 at-risk) and ~17 bookings in various states. Updates `trips.available_seats`. |
| 7 | **API server** | app | Runs `node app.js`: connects to Postgres via `db:5432`, starts Express on port 5001, starts auto-expiry job (every 1 min). |
| 8 | **Ready** | — | API at `http://localhost:5001`. DB at `localhost:5432` (optional host access). |

### Stop and remove

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Reset DB and rebuild

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up --build
```

### Reset DB (including data volume)

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build
```

### Skip schema + seed on restart

Set `SKIP_SCHEMA_SEED=1` in the app service environment in `docker-compose.yml` if you only want to restart the app without reseeding.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:5001`

## 4. Implementation logic (non-CRUD routes)

### POST /api/trips/:tripId/book (Create booking)

**Goal:** Reserve seats and create a PENDING_PAYMENT booking. Prevent overbooking.

1. **Transaction:** Single DB transaction with row-level lock.
2. **Lock trip:** `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the trip row so concurrent requests queue.
3. **Validate:** Trip exists, status = PUBLISHED, `available_seats >= num_seats`. If not → 409.
4. **Compute:** `price_at_booking = trip.price × num_seats`, `expires_at = now + 15 min`, `idempotency_key` = request body or generated UUID.
5. **Decrement seats:** `UPDATE trips SET available_seats = available_seats - num_seats`.
6. **Insert booking:** state = PENDING_PAYMENT.
7. **Commit.** Return booking + mocked `payment_url` including `idempotency_key` for webhook deduplication.

**Concurrency:** Two users booking the last seat; only one succeeds. The other gets 409 after the lock is released.

---

### POST /api/bookings/:id/cancel (Cancel booking)

**Goal:** Cancel CONFIRMED or PENDING_PAYMENT (before cutoff) bookings. Apply refund policy and optionally release seats.

1. **Load booking + trip:** Get `start_date`, `refundable_until_days_before`, `cancellation_fee_percent` for cutoff and refund.
2. **Validate state:** CANCELLED/EXPIRED → 409.
3. **Cutoff:** `cutoffDate = start_date - refundable_until_days_before days`. Compare `now` with `cutoffDate`.
4. **Logic:**
   - **PENDING_PAYMENT before cutoff:** `refund_amount = 0` (no payment received), `releaseSeats = true`.
   - **PENDING_PAYMENT after cutoff:** 409 (trip imminent, cannot cancel unpaid hold).
   - **CONFIRMED before cutoff:** `refund_amount = price_at_booking × (1 - cancellation_fee_percent/100)`, `releaseSeats = true`.
   - **CONFIRMED after cutoff:** `refund_amount = 0`, `releaseSeats = false` (don’t release seats; trip is imminent).
5. **Transaction:** Update booking (state = CANCELLED, cancelled_at, refund_amount). If `releaseSeats`, increment trip’s `available_seats`.

---

### POST /api/payments/webhook (Payment provider callback)

**Goal:** Process success/failure from payment provider. Idempotent so duplicate webhooks are safe. Always return 200.

1. **Idempotency check:** If `idempotency_key` provided, look up booking by key. If state already CONFIRMED or EXPIRED → no-op, return 200.
2. **Transaction:** Lock booking with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
3. **Validate:** Booking exists, state = PENDING_PAYMENT. If not → no-op, return 200 (never fail the provider).
4. **Process:**
   - **status = success:** `UPDATE booking SET state = CONFIRMED`, set `payment_reference`. Commit.
   - **status = failed:** `UPDATE booking SET state = EXPIRED`, increment trip’s `available_seats` by `num_seats`. Commit.
5. **Response:** Always 200 + `{ received: true }`. Never surface internal errors to the provider.

---

### Auto-expiry (background job)

**Goal:** Expire PENDING_PAYMENT bookings when `expires_at` has passed and no webhook arrived.

1. **Scheduler:** Runs every 60 seconds (`setInterval` in app.js).
2. **Query:** `SELECT id, trip_id, num_seats FROM bookings WHERE state = 'PENDING_PAYMENT' AND expires_at < NOW()`.
3. **For each:** In a transaction, lock booking, verify still PENDING_PAYMENT, update to EXPIRED, increment trip’s `available_seats`. Handles race with webhook (only one wins).
4. **Failure:** One failed expiry does not stop others; errors are logged.

---

### GET /admin/trips/:tripId/metrics (Trip metrics)

**Goal:** Return occupancy, booking summary, and financials for a trip.

1. **Trip:** Load `id`, `title`, `max_capacity`, `available_seats`.
2. **Occupancy:** `booked_seats = max_capacity - available_seats`, `occupancy_percent = (booked_seats / max_capacity) × 100`.
3. **Booking summary:** `SELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE trip_id = ? GROUP BY state` → map to `{ confirmed, pending_payment, cancelled, expired }`.
4. **Financial:** `gross_revenue = SUM(price_at_booking)` for CONFIRMED, `refunds_issued = SUM(refund_amount)`, `net_revenue = gross_revenue - refunds_issued`.
5. **404** if trip not found.

---

### GET /admin/trips/at-risk (At-risk trips)

**Goal:** List trips departing within 7 days with occupancy &lt; 50%.

1. **Query:** `SELECT id, title, start_date, max_capacity, available_seats FROM trips WHERE start_date >= NOW() AND start_date < NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'`.
2. **Filter:** For each trip, `occupancy_percent = ((max_capacity - available_seats) / max_capacity) × 100`. Keep only where `occupancy_percent < 50`.
3. **Response:** `{ at_risk_trips: [{ trip_id, title, departure_date, occupancy_percent, reason }] }`. Reason: "Low occupancy with imminent departure".

---

## 5. Testing guide (Postman)

**Import collections from `postman test files/`:** GoTyolo - Trips API, GoTyolo - Booking API, GoTyolo - Admin API.

Use a **PUBLISHED** trip for booking. Copy `id` from responses into `tripId` and `bookingId` as needed.

---

### Step 1 – Trips (read)

| # | Request | Collection | What to do |
|---|---------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Get All Trips | Trips | Send. Copy one trip `id` → set **tripId** in the collection (or in all three). |
| 2 | Get Published Trips | Trips | Send. Check only PUBLISHED trips are returned. |
| 3 | Get Trip By ID | Trips | Send (uses `tripId`). Check 200 and correct trip. |

---

### Step 2 – Trips (create/update/delete)

| # | Request | Collection | What to do |
|---|---------|------------|------------|
| 4 | Create Trip | Trips | Send. Copy returned `id` → set **tripId** (or keep step 1 ID for booking). |
| 5 | Update Trip | Trips | Change body (e.g. `title`, `price`, `status: "PUBLISHED"`). Send. Check 200. |
| 6 | Get Trip By ID | Trips | Send. Confirm updated fields. |
| 7 | Delete Trip | Trips | Optional: use a trip you don't need for bookings. Send. Then Get Trip By ID → 404. |

---

### Step 3 – Booking (full flow)

Use a **PUBLISHED** trip for `tripId` (e.g. from step 1 or the one you updated to PUBLISHED in step 5).

| # | Request | Collection | What to do |
|---|---------|------------|------------|
| 8 | Create Booking | Booking | Set **tripId** = PUBLISHED trip ID. Send. Copy returned `id` → set **bookingId**. Check 201, `state: "PENDING_PAYMENT"`, `payment_url`. |
| 9 | Get Booking By ID | Booking | Send. Check `state: "PENDING_PAYMENT"`. |
| 10 | Payment Webhook | Booking | Body: `"status": "success"` (and same `booking_id`, `idempotency_key`). Send. Check 200, `received: true`. |
| 11 | Get Booking By ID | Booking | Send again. Check `state: "CONFIRMED"`. |
| 12 | Cancel Booking | Booking | Send (same `bookingId`). Check 200, `cancelled: true`, `refund_amount` (if before cutoff). |
| 13 | Get Booking By ID | Booking | Send. Check `state: "CANCELLED"`. |

---

### Step 3b – Cancel PENDING_PAYMENT (before cutoff)

Cancel a booking **before** payment. Do **not** call Payment Webhook.

| # | Request | Collection | What to do |
|---|---------|------------|------------|
| 8a | Create Booking | Booking | Set **tripId** = PUBLISHED trip with start_date far ahead (e.g. Paris, April 2026). Send. Copy `id` → set **bookingId**. |
| 8b | Cancel PENDING_PAYMENT (before cutoff) | Booking | Send (do **not** call Payment Webhook first). Expect 200, `{ cancelled: true, refund_amount: 0 }`. Seats released. |
| 8c | Get Booking By ID | Booking | Send. Check `state: "CANCELLED"`. |

**Note:** Run within ~15 minutes of creating the booking; otherwise auto-expiry may set it to EXPIRED.

---

### Step 4 – Payment webhook (failed path)

| # | Request | Collection | What to do |
|---|---------|------------|------------|
| 14 | Create Booking | Booking | Use same or another PUBLISHED **tripId**. Send. Copy new `id` → set **bookingId**. |
| 15 | Payment Webhook | Booking | Body: `"status": "failed"`. Send. Check 200. |
| 16 | Get Booking By ID | Booking | Send. Check `state: "EXPIRED"`. |

---

### Step 5 – Admin

| # | Request | Collection | What to do |
|---|---------|------------|------------|
| 17 | Get Trip Metrics | Admin | Set **tripId** to any existing trip. Send. Check 200, `occupancy_percent`, `booking_summary`, `financial`. |
| 18 | Get At-Risk Trips | Admin | Send. Check 200, `at_risk_trips` (array; may be empty; seed includes at-risk trips). |

---

### Quick checklist

```
Trips:     Get All → Get Published → Get By ID → Create → Update → Get By ID [→ Delete]
Booking:   Create → Get → Webhook success → Get (CONFIRMED) → Cancel → Get (CANCELLED)
Cancel PENDING: Create → Cancel (no webhook) → Get (CANCELLED, refund_amount: 0)
Webhook:   Create → Webhook failed → Get (EXPIRED)
Admin:     Get Trip Metrics → Get At-Risk Trips
```

If you run through this order and every request returns the expected status and body, all features are in a working state.

---

## 6. Local setup (without Docker)

When running locally, you need a `.env` file to connect to Postgres. Docker does not use `.env` (it gets config from `docker-compose.yml`).

1. `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` – the connection string to your local Postgres:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
   DATABASE_SSL=false
   ```
   Example: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://app:appsecret@localhost:5432/gotyolo`. Set `DATABASE_SSL=false` for local Postgres without SSL.
3. `npm run schema` && `npm run seed`
4. `npm run dev` (port 5001)
